# Security Policy

## Supported versions

We currently maintain the latest released version (available on PyPI) and the `main` branch. Older versions may receive fixes on a best-effort basis, but security updates are only guaranteed for the most recent release.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please report it privately by emailing [cturyasiima@gmail.com](mailto:cturyasiima@gmail.com).

Include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce the issue (environment, steps, sample input). We aim to respond within **72 hours** and, if the report is confirmed, to release a fix within **14 days**.

Please do not disclose the issue publicly until we have released a patch or agreed on a coordinated disclosure timeline.

## Preferred languages

Reports in English are appreciated.

Thank you for helping keep the project safe for everyone!
